    The Era of the Arts is, truthfully, one of the most important eras Minecraft has experienced throughout its 16-year-long history. The worlds of traditional art and Minecraft began to blend together into one. Many players used many traditional art techniques, such as composition and colour theory.

    Sketching is one of the most essential elements of creating an artistic piece, and Minecraft building began to consider sketching as a vital tool in its arsenal. While some had been doing it for a long time, for many in recent years, it has been a new aspect of building that the average viewer didn’t think about.

 This Era is still one that is ongoing and many artists exist within the Minecraft community. There are four of them in particular that masterfully mix their traditional art mediums with their builds. These four are Jamal_MC, PearlescentMoon, BdoubleO100, and, Mumbo Jumbo.

    Many other creators use these techniques, such as Mythical Sausage and Emiannder. 
The Era of the Arts truly is one of the most incredible time periods in Minecraft build history and has molded everything. Though many don’t even realise it, they use these techniques every day to prototype and create. The creativity is boundless with many in this community, and now the next era proves that Motion and animation are possible within Minecraft.
